app:
  - requests.dart shows the different ride requests by students.
  - driver_registrstion.dart is the page for drivers to register.
  - driver.dart shows the profile of a driver available for pickup
  - map.dart shows the map and the form for requesting ride.
  - ride_request.dart makes post request to flask api.
  - user.dart makes a post request to the flask api.
  - checking if it changes.




bugs:
  - validating forms, not allow submission if fields are empty (fixed with alert box)
  - Firebase Initialise app error
  - escaping login page after log in (fixed with shared preferences -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52831605/flutter-shared-preferences/54031842#54031842) 
  - insufficient space to store list in sharedpreferences(idea--clear cache in app on the emulator--worked)
  - use post request for API
  - messages to driver upon new request
